## Introduction
The primary goal of [ACNH Colleactions](git@github.com:thaomonster/ACNH-Collections.git) is to have the user be able to see more details about a villager, favorite villager and search villager. ([Project Specs](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html)).

#### Motivation
The motivation behind this projects creation was to build an application to help the user find more details of a villager while  focused on using React as a framework, writing DRY JS, SASS, and accessing data with apis and solidifying good habits in git workflow.

#### Villager List
Upon page load the site will fetch a list of villagers and display a grid of villager thumbnail image and name. Each villagers's thumbnail image is clickable to redirect you to a new page showing a villager's passport information. A user will also be able to search through the list for a specific villager.

Once they have added as much as they want to favorite you are able to click on the leaf in the header and show the favorite list. When a user is done with the favorite list they can click on the title in the header and go back to the home page.
